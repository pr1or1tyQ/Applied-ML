This model was trained off the Elastic Malware Benchmark for Empowering Researchers (EMBER) 2018 dataset. This dataset contained features from 1 million portable executable (PE) files. The raw features were extracted and vectorized utilizing a script provided by the authors of the dataset. One point of further research would be analyzing the extraction script and possibly modifying it to be more suited for a neural-network model. The authors utilized a decision tree model. For this project I created a neural network model in a similar fasion to the network intrusion model. Initial performance of this model was a a poor 50 percent accuracy. Improvement were first made in making the model more complex by adding layers and strictly using linear unit (relu) activation in contrast to also applying a sigmoid activation function. Further work was done testing various loss functions and optimizers settling on the binary_crossentropy loss function with the Adadelta optimizer. One of the most significant improvements was a simple modification of the dataset; originally the data was labled with 1 for malicious, 0 for benign, and -1 for unlabeled. By removing all occurrences of data labled as -1 the binary_crossentropy function was able to perform better with final accuracy measurements at 74.99 percent.

Further improvement to this model will include further data modification and modifying the input to the neural network. It would also be important to apply the existing model to other similar PE datasets in order to see how the model performs on unknown data of a different format.
