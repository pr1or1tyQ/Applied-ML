## Outside the Closed World: On Using Machine Learning For Network Intrusion Detection

---

Provides discussion on the use of machine learning for detecting network intrusions. It argues that traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) have limitations and are not suitable for dynamic and evolving network environments. Machine learning, on the other hand, offers the potential to overcome these limitations and improve intrusion detection accuracy. The article highlights the importance of using diverse training data and avoiding over-fitting in order to achieve effective intrusion detection using machine learning. Additionally, the article emphasizes the need for transparency and interpretability in machine learning-based IDS, as well as the importance of constantly updating and re-training the models to keep up with evolving network threats. A useful portion of this article in reference to development testing is its discussion on how to properly understand results and asses how the model is performing.

## Network Intrusion Detection System: A Systematic Study of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches

---

Examines the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for network intrusion detection. It conducts a systematic study of the existing literature on these approaches and compares their performance and limitations. The study finds that machine learning methods, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests, have been widely used for intrusion detection and have shown good results while deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have also been successful but require large amounts of data for training. Suggests future research should focus on improving the interpretability of deep learning-based intrusion detection systems. Of note for use within the article are references to datasets, the attacks they feature, and descriptions of their use/limitations. 

## Classification of Malware Attacks Using Machine Learning in Decision Tree

---

Focuses on using decision tree machine learning algorithms to classify malware attacks. The article describes how decision trees can be used to identify and categorize different types of malware based on their characteristics and behavior. The study resulted in two scenarios: the prediction of the probability of penetration on endpoint nodes and the prediction of manipulation on the various endpoint nodes. In many ways the decision trees were effective in outperforming other traditional classification methods. Additionally, the article highlights the importance of using diverse and balanced training data to improve the accuracy of the decision tree model. Decision tree-based malware classification can be a valuable tool for enhancing the security of computer systems by detecting and preventing malware attacks. The dataset used in the study was from the Microsoft Malware threat prediction website Kaggle. An interesting point in this article is its discussion of adversary attacks on machine learning models.

## A New Malware Classification Framework Based on Deep Learning Algorithms

---

Discusses new frameworks for classifying malware using deep learning algorithms. The framework is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Through the study it is found that deep learning algorithms can effectively learn and classify malware based on their behavior and features, improving upon traditional malware classification methods. The article also highlights the importance of using a large and diverse dataset to train the deep learning models and the need for updating and retraining the models as new malware evolves.  An important component of this article is the dicussion of feature extraction from the raw data sets in order to develop a model particularly n-gram, m-bag, k-tuple, and the diagram model. There are various techniques for classification: graph based, visision based, behavior baset, etc. In conclusion the article finds the proposed deep learning-based framework has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of malware classification and contribute to the overall improvement of computer security.
